## Abstract
In recent years, social media sites have become important arenas for political debate. However, studies on social media debates in the context of Swiss elections are still rare. This paper investigates how the Twitter debate on the Responsible Business Initiative is structured and how it differs from debates in traditional media.

Using Twitter data from over 5800 users, the study identifies seven distinct communities that vary in size, position and contribution to the debate. The analysis highlights the complex interactions between these communities and the implications for political discourse.

## Methods
The description of the methods used can be found in the PDF file of the Master's thesis in Chapter 5 “Methods and operationalizations”. 

To explore the data analysis and replicate the results:
1. Review the `1_getData_hastags.R` script in the `/scripts/` folder.
2. The script demonstrates how to collect Twitter data, but note that the actual dataset used in this study is not included in this repository for privacy reasons.
